Now, finish a story using the Dan Harmon circle. Here's the start of the story: ```
Mushroom, Giraffe, and Elephant stumble upon a secret trampoline hidden deep in the forest, rumored to grant extraordinary powers with each jump. As they bounce higher, they start swapping abilitiesâ€”Mushroom gains Giraffe's height, Elephant shrinks to Mushroom's size, and Giraffe develops super-strength. When the trampoline reveals its true purpose as a portal to an ancient realm where creatures must exchange traits to survive, the friends must navigate their bizarre transformations and work together to unlock the trampoline's final, reality-bending leap.

## New short story prompts

Write a 300 to 400 word story about a casual game of Clue gone bad as there is actually a murderer. As for the story structure, it should begin with an introductory exposition before rapidly transitioning to a shocking event or reveal. This should continue throughout the story, more and more twists and surprises that gradually become more and more ludicrous and unbelievable.

See, this is good, but there's only 2 twists and suprises in the story. Its okay if you make it a little bit longer, but I need at least 5 super shocking twists, like the murder suspect was actually innocent, or the person they though was murdered was actually in on it, more and more ludicrous and ridiculous twists
