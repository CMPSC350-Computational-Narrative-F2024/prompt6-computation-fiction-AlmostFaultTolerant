It was a rainy Saturday night when six friends gathered at Olivia's house for a cozy evening of board games. After a few rounds of charades, they decided to spice things up with Clue, the classic whodunit game. The friends settled around the table—Olivia, Tom, Lucy, Mark, Emily, and Greg—each picking their character and laying out the cards. Laughter and snacks filled the room as they began to make their way through the mansion of suspects, weapons, and motives.

Olivia, playing as Miss Scarlet, was the first to make an accusation. “I think it was Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with the rope!” she declared dramatically. Everyone chuckled, but Tom, who was playing Colonel Mustard, shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Lucy leaned forward to refute Olivia's guess when suddenly, Tom stood up, his face pale. "I need some air," he muttered, backing away from the table.

The friends exchanged puzzled glances, but Greg laughed, shrugging it off as Tom being overly dramatic. They resumed the game, but before long, a loud crash came from the kitchen. Emily jumped up, rushing to see what had happened. She found Tom sprawled across the kitchen floor, a rope wrapped loosely around his ankle. "Uh, guys? This... this isn't funny," she called out, her voice shaking.

The group gathered around, gasping at the sight. Tom’s face was pale and lifeless. Mark knelt to check his pulse, looking up at the others, his voice barely a whisper, "He's dead." The room fell into silence, the Clue board game still spread out on the table, a grim echo of reality.

“This can’t be real,” Lucy stammered, her eyes wide. Olivia backed away, her gaze fixed on the rope. “Who would do this?” she whispered. Suddenly, the lights flickered, and the door slammed shut. A voice crackled over the intercom—an intercom none of them remembered Olivia having—“You have one hour to find the real killer, or you all will meet the same fate.”

Panic set in as everyone looked around, their faces masks of disbelief. "Wait, is this... is this some kind of twisted prank?" Greg asked, his voice cracking. Emily shook her head, pointing towards the Clue board, where a card that wasn't there before had appeared. It read: "The killer is among you."

Mark stood, grabbing a candlestick from the fireplace. "No one is leaving until we figure this out," he said, his voice trembling. Olivia laughed nervously, "You’re kidding, right?"

Suddenly, Tom's body moved. Everyone screamed as Tom sat up, coughing. "It was just a joke!" he wheezed, his voice weak. "I wanted to scare you guys." The group stared, bewildered, as Tom tried to stand. "But... the rope," Emily stammered. Tom shook his head, "I set it up before the game started. It was supposed to be harmless."

Before anyone could react, the lights went out completely. There was a scream, followed by a loud thud. When the lights flickered back on, Lucy was on the floor, unconscious, a wrench lying next to her. Greg's eyes widened, "Who did that?!" he yelled, his voice breaking. Olivia backed away, her hands trembling. "This isn't funny anymore!"

Mark's eyes narrowed, and he pointed at Emily. "You were closest to her!" he accused. Emily shook her head violently, tears streaming down her face. "No! I swear, it wasn't me!" Suddenly, the intercom crackled again. "The game must continue. Only one will survive."

Greg, in a panic, ran to the door, trying to force it open, but it wouldn't budge. "We're trapped!" he shouted. Olivia looked at the Clue board, her eyes widening as she noticed something new—another card had appeared. It read: "The victim is not who you think."

Lucy suddenly sat up, gasping for air. "It was a setup!" she cried out. "I was in on it with Tom! But this... this wasn't part of the plan!" The others looked at her in shock. "What do you mean?" Mark demanded. Lucy pointed at the intercom. "Someone else is controlling this now!"

By the time the police arrived—alerted by a neighbor who heard the screaming—they found five people locked in the living room, each clutching a different makeshift weapon, staring at each other with wild, terrified eyes. The officers exchanged baffled looks as they surveyed the scene, the Clue board game still in the center of it all. And there, in the middle of the board, was the final twist: a note that simply read, "Game over.
